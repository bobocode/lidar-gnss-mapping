# lidar-gnss-mapping
This repository works on tightly fusing raw GNSS measuremtns with LiDAR information for localizationa and mapping. The LOAM/Lidar Odometry part is adapted and refactored from [ALOAM](https://github.com/tops666/Aloam).
- [x] online alignment
- [x] tightly-couple fusion via FGO framework for localization
- [x] Mapping
