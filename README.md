<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository works on tightly fusing raw GNSS measuremtns with LiDAR information for localizationa and mapping. The LOAM/Lidar Odometry part is adapted and refactored from [ALOAM](https://github.com/tops666/Aloam).
- [x] online alignment
- [x] tightly-couple fusion via FGO framework for localization
- [x] 3D Map
=======
This repository works on tightly fusing raw GNSS measuremtns, IMU with LiDAR information for localizationa and mapping.
Currently, gnss is aligned by using IMUï¼Œ which means gnss cannot be utilized in the sytem if imu was not used or went wrong.
***More code is coming...***  
***to do list***
- [x] online alignment between LiDAR and GNSS
- [x] reduce performance time when processing 3d point cloud
# Acknowledge
